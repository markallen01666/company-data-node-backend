# company-data-node-backend
A company info API backend to support React CRUD frontend

API built using Node, Express, and Mongoose. Backend software links to a MongoDB NoSQL database hosted on MongoDB Atlas

This is a new Node/Express/Mongoose backend to serve my company data test project. This is part of an ongoing project to improve my skills. I am building a simple company data interface for a fictional company. The interface allows the user to read, add, update, and delete staff and office records.

The frontend is hosted on Google Firebase, talking to a Node/Express/Mongoose backend hosted on Heroku. The backend in turn interacts with a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

This project is very much a work in progress - so some buttons do not currently work. Current emphasis is on the option to create a new office record and refresh the view on success.
